# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

import React from 'react';  //This imports the core React library, which is necessary to create React components and hooks.
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'; //This imports the ReactDOM package, specifically the createRoot function from the react-dom/client module. ReactDOM is used for rendering React components to the DOM.
import './index.css';//This imports the CSS file index.css for applying global styles to the application.
import App from './App'; //This imports the App component from the App.js file. This component is the root component of the application.
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals'; //This imports a function for measuring performance in the app.
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); //This line creates a root DOM node where the React application will be mounted. 
                                                                   //document.getElementById('root') selects the DOM element with the ID root, 
                                                                   //and ReactDOM.createRoot creates a root instance in this element.
root.render(   //This method renders the React component tree into the root DOM node created in the previous step.
//This is a wrapper component provided by React to enable additional checks and warnings for its descendants. It helps in identifying potential problems in an application.
//- This renders the App component inside the React.StrictMode component.   
  <React.StrictMode>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <App/> 
    </BrowserRouter>
  </React.StrictMode>
);

// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals(); //This function call is used to measure and report the performance of the application.
