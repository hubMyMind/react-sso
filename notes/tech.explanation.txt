The import statement makes modular code possible in JavaScript (and also, code reuse and sharing). 
Without import or a similar mechanism, a developer could only write a JavaScript program as a single program in one file.

With import, developers can break a program into manageable modules and consolidate the pieces as needed. 
A developer can use a code module in more than one project, sometimes as part of a library of frequently re-used utilities or shared functionality.

A module is a JavaScript file that contains features (functions or variables) that can be imported and used by another JavaScript program.

export default App; - This line exports the App component as the default export of the module, making it available for import in other parts of the application.
